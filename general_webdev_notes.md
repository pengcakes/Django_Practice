Internet

1. URL - uniform resource locator.
- Contains Scheme (protocol used to make connection ex: https --> TLS)
- domain - name of the address
- path - specific files on server

2. DNS lookup
3. Browser to server + makes HTTPS request (HTTPS is a request response protocol)
4. Browser receives response headers and renders content


Modern web development separates into Frontend + Backend.

Client Tools: React, Angular, Vue
Server Tools: Django, ASP.NET Core, Flask

Django provides an API for clients. Buttons on a controller to interact w/ the server data.

REST Frameworks
- REST - REpresentational State Transfer
- A style of design that makes it easier for computer systems to communicate
- Separation of Client and Server. Client and server can be changed without
affecting each other's operation.
- Stateless Systems - servers and clients don't need to know what state the other is in
- This is achieved by describing objects instead of defining them (think HTPP Request)

Why use REST Frameworks?
If you want to have a website where users can make changes to info stored on the backend, you'd
want them to be able to do so in any OS.

If you want to just have a simple webpage that displays data, only using a framework is fine.
